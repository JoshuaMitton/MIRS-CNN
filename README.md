These are the models used to create the paper Age and species prediction of natural malaria mosquitoes through deep learning of mid-infrared spectra.

These are Tensorflow models for the task of classifying age and species of lab reared lab mosquitoes, lab reared field mosquitoes, and semi-field reared lab mosqutioes.
